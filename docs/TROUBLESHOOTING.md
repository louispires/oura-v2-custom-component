# TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE - Integration Not Appearing

## Issue: Oura Integration Not Showing in Home Assistant

If you've copied the integration to custom_components but can't see it when trying to add integrations, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Verify File Structure

Your Home Assistant config directory should look like this:

```
config/
  custom_components/
    oura/
      __init__.py
      api.py
      application_credentials.py
      config_flow.py
      const.py
      coordinator.py
      manifest.json
      sensor.py
      strings.json
      translations/
        en.json
```

### Step 2: Check Home Assistant Logs

1. Go to Settings  System  Logs
2. Look for any errors containing "oura"
3. Common errors to look for:
   - Import errors
   - Manifest validation errors
   - Python syntax errors

### Step 3: Verify Manifest.json

The manifest.json must be valid JSON. Check that:
- No trailing commas
- All quotes are properly closed
- File is UTF-8 encoded

### Step 4: Restart Home Assistant

**Important**: A full restart is required, not just a reload:

1. Settings  System  Restart
2. Wait for Home Assistant to fully restart (check the UI comes back up)
3. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Step 5: Check Integration Requirements

For Home Assistant 2024.1.0+, the integration needs:
- Valid manifest.json with all required fields
- Proper config_flow.py implementation
- OAuth2 flow properly configured

### Step 6: Enable Debug Logging

Add to your configuration.yaml:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    homeassistant.loader: debug
    custom_components.oura: debug
```

Then restart and check logs for detailed error messages.

### Common Issues and Fixes

#### Issue: "Integration has invalid manifest"
**Fix**: Check manifest.json syntax, ensure all required fields are present

#### Issue: "Failed to import component"
**Fix**: Check Python syntax in all .py files, verify imports

#### Issue: "Config flow not found"
**Fix**: Ensure config_flow.py has proper OuraFlowHandler class

#### Issue: Integration shows but configuration fails
**Fix**: 
1. Check OAuth2 URLs in const.py
2. Verify application_credentials.py is present
3. Ensure you've set up application credentials first

### Manual Verification Steps

Run these commands from your Home Assistant config directory:

```bash
# Check if files exist
ls -la custom_components/oura/

# Validate JSON
cat custom_components/oura/manifest.json | python -m json.tool

# Check Python syntax
python3 -m py_compile custom_components/oura/__init__.py
python3 -m py_compile custom_components/oura/config_flow.py
```

### Still Not Working?

1. **Remove and re-copy files**:
   - Delete custom_components/oura/
   - Re-copy from the repository
   - Ensure no hidden files or cache

2. **Check file permissions**:
   - Files should be readable by the Home Assistant user
   - On Linux: chmod -R 755 custom_components/oura/

3. **Try a different browser**:
   - Clear cache completely
   - Try incognito/private mode

4. **Check Home Assistant version**:
   - Requires HA 2024.1.0 or higher
   - Update if necessary

### Getting Help

If still not working, gather this information:

1. Home Assistant version
2. Installation method (Docker, HAOS, Core, Supervised)
3. Full error from logs (Settings  System  Logs)
4. Output of: ls -la custom_components/oura/
5. Content of manifest.json
